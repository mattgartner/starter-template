## extensions

* &#x1F536; &nbsp; gulp-sourcemaps: adds source map support to gulp [https://github.com/gulp-sourcemaps/gulp-sourcemaps]

* &#x1F536; &nbsp; postcss-cssnext: helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. It transforms CSS specs into more compatible CSS so you donâ€™t need to wait for browser support. [https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-cssnext] **may include autoprefixer already - consider removing**

* &#x1F534; &nbsp; postcss-scss: **may be unnecessary if moving just to PostCSS altogether - consider removing** main use case of this plugin is to apply PostCSS transformations directly to SCSS source code. For example, if you ship a theme written in SCSS and need Autoprefixer to add the appropriate vendor prefixes to it; or you need to lint SCSS with a plugin such as Stylelint [https://github.com/postcss/postcss-scss] 

* &#x1F536; &nbsp; postcss-sorting: PostCSS plugin to keep rules and at-rules content in order [https://github.com/hudochenkov/postcss-sorting]

* &#x1F536; &nbsp; gulp-cached: keeps an in-memory cache of files (and their contents) that have passed through it. If a file has already passed through on the last run it will not be passed downstream. This means you only process what you need and save time + resources. [https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cached]
